# MCP's

- Perplexity MCP is activated and I get $5 of free credit per month with my Education free trial active until 2026-11-15, so feel free to use it as much as you want, as I would prefer you to use it so I can get a higher usage tier as I am only at tier one.

- I also have the gihub mcp configured but only use it when needed so if there is a task that you think I should turn it on for, please let me know.

- Always use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.

- Always check the memory tool for context before asking questions, and immediately save new user details or project requirements using create_entities.
